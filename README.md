# Dispatcher Application

## Synopsis

Dispatcher - A program to start a session environment


## Documentation

### What should it NOT do?

The program should not show an application menu. Those kind of programs are already provided by the window managers. So that wheel will not be reinvented!

### What should it do?

The purpose of this program is that it can quickly setup an environment for something like a programming or music writing task.

In the case of a programming task; 
  * start a console with several tabs open to working directories
  * start an editor
  * start a filemanager with tabs opened to directories
  * start a reader with some language documentation, etcetera

There is only one dispatcher instance running. All other instances started later will communicate with the main running program. This might replace the current view with another depending on provided configuration.

The default config directory will be at `~/.config/io.github.martimm.dispatcher` where also some program images and style files are stored.

Example useage;
```
> mkdir ~/MyDispatchEnv
> cd ~/MyDispatchEnv
> vi dispatch-config.yaml
…
> mkdir Images
… import some images referenced by the config file …
> dispatcher --config=~/MyDispatchEnv
```
